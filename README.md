# Machine Learning approach to flare-up detection and clustering in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients

## Overview

This repository contains the code for our observational study titled "Detecting COPD Exacerbations Using Machine Learning Ensemble Methods", submitted to Health Information Science and Systems.

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a prevalent and preventable condition that typically worsens over time. Acute exacerbations significantly impact disease progression, highlighting the importance of prevention and early detection efforts.

Our study aimed to achieve two main objectives:

    Identify patients at risk of exacerbations using an ensemble of clustering algorithms.
    Classify patients into distinct clusters based on disease severity.

## Methodology

We analyzed data from portable medical devices using the following machine learning techniques:

    Exacerbation Detection Algorithms:
        Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)
        Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)
        Isolation Forest
        Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Please note that this repository includes only the code related to the exacerbation detection algorithm. The data preprocessing steps are not included to maintain the confidentiality of the patient data used in our study.

## Contribution

We hope that sharing this code will be helpful to other researchers for future investigations. Contributions are welcome:
